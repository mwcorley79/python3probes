Python 3 tests (probes for myself) as I explore, and continue the learn and use the language. 

Example # 1:    This is first version port of Dr. Fawcetts's Cpp11 BlockingQueue: https://github.com/JimFawcett/CppBlockingQueue to Python 3
"A Thread-safe message queue that blocks deQuer when queue is empty"

pybq.py - implements a (initial) basic BQ class
python_bq_test.py - a simple test executive

Run command: python python_bq_test.py
